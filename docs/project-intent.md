# Project Intent: NEXUS

## Product Definition
NEXUS is a developer knowledge platform where AI-assisted implementation records become reusable context assets.

## Not Just a Blog
This repository supports a feedback loop:
1. feature planning and implementation with code agents
2. verification and release
3. extraction of insights and lessons learned
4. publication and future context reuse

## Strategic Goals
- Build a high-quality personal operating system for AI-assisted development (Phase A)
- Validate external beta adoption and contributor growth (Phase B)

## Quarterly KPI Baseline
- Monthly posts: 5
- Context reuse rate: 40%
- Beta applicants: 10

## Context Reuse Rate Definition
Primary formula:
- ratio of new posts that reused existing templates/context artifacts

Extended signal:
- track MCP-based context retrieval attempts from prior posts and feed this into reuse analytics.

## Success Conditions
- Growing volume of reusable, verifiable technical context
- Reduced repeated mistakes in similar implementations
- Increasing contributor/reader engagement around reusable insights
