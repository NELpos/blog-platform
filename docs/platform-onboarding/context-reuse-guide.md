# Platform Onboarding: Context Reuse Guide

## Goal
Reuse prior context assets to reduce repeated trial-and-error.

## Reuse Workflow
1. Search relevant prior posts/templates
2. Pull required context through MCP/tooling
3. Adapt context to current feature scope
4. Record what was reused and what changed

## Reuse Metrics
Core events:
- `search_used`
- `reuse_doc_opened`
- `feature_used`
- `draft_saved`
- `publish_clicked`

Primary KPI mapping:
- Context reuse rate = percentage of new posts with template/context reuse
