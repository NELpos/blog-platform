# Platform Onboarding: AI Content Policy

## Disclosure
- AI-generated support must be labeled at post level in web output.

## Security and Compliance
- never expose private code or secrets
- validate third-party license compatibility
- keep traceability of source references where relevant

## Quality Standard
A strong technical post should include:
- Context
- Decision
- Tradeoff
- Implementation
- Validation
- Lessons Learned

## Preferred Insight Pattern
Document failure-to-success transitions:
- where context was insufficient
- where the agent missed root cause
- which harness improvements were required
