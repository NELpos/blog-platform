# Layer 08: Reporting

## Location
- `docs/changes/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-change.md`

## Report Format Source of Truth
- Use `docs/harness/templates/change-report.template.md` as the canonical report format.
- Keep report fields centralized in that template to avoid drift.

## Soft Gate Exception Rule
- If a required section is missing, include `Exception Rationale` and next corrective action.
