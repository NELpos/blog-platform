# Layer 03: Frontend Flow

## When This Layer Applies
- New page creation
- Large layout/interaction redesign

## Required Sequence
1. Define UX goal and pass criteria.
2. Design in Google Stitch.
3. Save/organize generated layout artifacts under `stich/`.
4. Review implementation feasibility with shadcn MCP.
5. Implement with current design system and accessibility checks.

## Scope Rule
Small UI fixes can skip mandatory Stitch design, but still need acceptance criteria and tests.
