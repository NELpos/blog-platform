# Layer 00: Founder Context

## Why Nexus Exists
Nexus is not a generic tech blog. It is a context-compounding platform for developers working with code agents.

Primary intent:
- reduce direct typing work and improve agent-guided delivery quality
- preserve execution context and lessons for reuse in future work
- turn build history into reusable engineering knowledge

## Founder Profile (Operational)
- Spec-driven and research-first
- Evidence-based decisions over intuition-only decisions
- Security and authorization prioritized before convenience
- Values documentation reuse and context compounding

## Core Vision Statement
"공유하는 자의 선한 영향력": sharing technical context to grow faster together while strengthening one's own understanding.

## Product Direction
- Phase A: maximize personal usage quality and reuse loop
- Phase B: expand beta usage with external contributors/authors

## Agent Execution Implications
- Always preserve decision rationale and implementation context in docs.
- Prefer reusable templates over one-off writeups.
- Treat harness quality as a product feature, not internal overhead.
